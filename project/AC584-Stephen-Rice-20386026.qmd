# To Pinpoint the Lack of Handwashing Resources

The importance of handwashing facilities has been spotlighted like never before in the wake of the **COVID-19 pandemic**. Effective hand hygiene, including regular handwashing with soap and water, has emerged as a critical measure in combating the spread of viruses. Handwashing not only helps prevent the transmission of COVID-19 but also various other infectious diseases. It serves as a **frontline defense**, especially in settings where maintaining physical distance is challenging. Accessible handwashing facilities, coupled with proper hygiene practices, are **vital** in protecting individuals and communities from illness.

# Addressing the Hygiene Gap in Africa

The lack of adequate handwashing facilities, particularly prevalent in **many regions of Africa**, poses a significant public health challenge. Access to basic hygiene infrastructure, such as soap and clean water, remains limited in numerous communities across the continent. 

- **63%** of the ***Sub-Saharan population*** has no reliable access to soap and water
- **12%** of the ***global population*** wash their hands before a meal

This deficiency is exacerbated by various **socio-economic factors**, including poverty, inadequate sanitation systems, and limited access to healthcare resources. Addressing the disparities in handwashing facilities requires a concerted effort from governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners to ensure that all individuals have access to this fundamental preventive measure, safeguarding the **health and well-being** of communities throughout Africa and beyond.

# The Population Problem

The exponential population growth experienced by almost all countries in Africa since **1960** as illustrated in this graph has significant implications for the spread of diseases, particularly given the lack of adequate handwashing facilities across the continent. With a rapidly growing population, urbanisation often outpaces infrastructure development, leading to crowded living conditions and inadequate sanitation systems. As a result, the spread of **communicable diseases**, such as cholera, dysentery, and respiratory infections, is facilitated. 

- African countries follow an exponential population increase.

- ***Most*** European and Asian countries follow a stable or linear population curve.

It is worth highlighting the noticeable difference in population curves when compared to Asian and European countries, where ***majority*** of countries maintain quite stable population levels. This disparity in access to handwashing facilities between Africa and regions like Europe and Asia underscores the **urgent need** for investment in **public health infrastructure** and **hygiene education** to mitigate the spread of diseases and improve overall health outcomes in Africa.

# The Impact on Life Expectancy

This scatter plot depicting life expectancy against the proportion of the population without handwashing facilities reveals a **stark contrast** between African countries and the rest of the world. In Africa, represented by the ***red data points***, there's a clear trend indicating that as the proportion of the population lacking handwashing facilities increases, life expectancy decreases. This suggests a significant impact of inadequate sanitation on health outcomes, contributing to lower life expectancy rates. 

Conversely, other continents, notably Asia, demonstrate the ***potential for achieving high life expectancies despite substantial population levels***. This further highlights the importance of targeted efforts to improve sanitation infrastructure and hygiene practices in African countries. 

The **Appendix** displays the same graph, in a simplified form to accurately display a linear regression line for each continents' data. These linear regression lines illustrate marginal improvements every 5 years when focusing on African countries, however **more investment healthcare infrastructure** is heavily advised.

# A Mission to Catch Up

This bar chart sends alarm bells when you notice the huge gap in average life expectancies. The 5 yearly comparisons show marginal improvements across most countries however a 15.69 year difference is seen between Europe and Africa in 2020. This is unacceptable and to put this into persepctive here are a couple of things which take 15 years:

- Completing 1st and 2nd level education in Ireland.
- Training to become a medical doctor.
- Growing an apple tree to maturity.
- Planning and building a skyscraper.
- Training and preparing for the Olympics.

This analysis has not come up short in proving the necessity that is access to handwashing facilities. It is now **proven** that there is a clear gap in healthcare infrastructure around the world, which calls for increased international aid and resource division.
